Hi! I am a third-year master student at [**Wuhan University**](https://whu.edu.cn). 
<!-- Where I am fortunate enough to be advised by Prof. Min Guo. -->

<!-- Prior to [**Dong Fureng Institute of Economics and Social Development**](http://www.whudfr.com/index.aspx), Wuhan University, I earned my Bachelor's degree from [**Printing and Package School, Wuhan University**](https://pps.whu.edu.cn/zxgk/zxjj.htm) in June 2021. I am extremely grateful to [**Prof. Yihua Zhou**](https://sns.whu.edu.cn/info/1019/20143.htm), **Prof. Min Guo**, **Dr. Jingwei Huang**, and [**Prof. Xun Li**](https://sites.google.com/site/xlihomepage/) who introduced me to the world of Printing and Economics! -->

My research interests lie broadly in **Health Economics** -- check my [**Research**](publications) or [**CV (PDF)**](CV_Tianlei.pdf) for more information. I am open to other topics as well; feel free to shoot me an email if you'd like to chat!
