However, few study has investigated the causal relationship between diet quality and cognitive performance. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the causal effects of diet quality on cognitive performance in Chinese adults aged 55 years and older. Particularly, we utilize the Chinese Diet Quality Index (CHEI), a dietary assessment tool tailored for Chinese populations, as a proxy for older adults’ diet quality.},

	title = {White {Death} in {Developing} {Countries}: {Evidence} from a {Tuberculosis} {Control} {Program} in {China}.},
	abstract = {Despite decades of efforts, while tuberculosis (TB) has largely been eliminated in developed countries, it remains a significant public health concern in developing countries. This study evaluates the impact of a TB control program in China. In the early 1990s, TB continued to pose a threat in China, prompting the government to launch a comprehensive program incorporating the Directly Observed Treatment Short-Course (DOTS) across 13 provinces between 1992 and 2001. Our findings show that the program not only increased the diagnosis of new TB cases but also reduced overall TB mortality and infection rates. The results related to sickness, employment, and child care align with the requirements and consequences of TB treatment, revealing varying patterns across age groups and urban-rural differences. The program's benefits extended to the next generation, increasing high school completion rates. A backof-the-envelope cost-benefit analysis confirms the program's cost-effectiveness. In conclusion, our findings underscore the success of TB control efforts and provide valuable lessons for other developing countries facing similar public health challenges.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the long and short-term effects of China's comprehensive control and prevention policy implemented in 2006 ("2006 policy" hereafter) targeting schistosomiasis, one of the seven most prevalent Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). The 2006 policy, a public health policy that emphasizes infectious source control, improves living environmental conditions and reduces schistosomiasis prevalence. Regarding long-term outcomes, we observe mixed results with significant gender heterogeneity including a decrease in hospitalization likelihood among males while an increase in feeling sick incidence, a decrease in junior high school completion probability and an increase in employment rates among females. Short-term analysis reveals that boys exhibit lower sickness likelihood while girls show higher sickness likelihood. Furthermore, girls are less likely to enroll in school and more likely to work. An increased access to toilets may be a potential explanation for the observed effects.},
